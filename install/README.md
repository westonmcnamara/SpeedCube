# Usage instructions

There are two files in this directory; `install.sh` and `speedcube`. In order to use them properly, they must be placed inside of the `Speedcube_Linux.zip` *release*. This should be done by a maintainer in order to avoid misplacing the files.

## Installation
1. `cd` into the unzipped `Speedcube_Linux.zip`
2. Run the command `sudo ./install.sh`.
3. To launch the game, run the command `speedcube`
