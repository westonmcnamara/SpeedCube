# SpeedCube
Infinite runner game. The player switches lanes to move out of the way of procedurally generated red blocks. Try and get the highest score. Do what you want with the source code.

Any scripts/models/scenes that arent in the release are in the "obsolete" folder. In the games first version before infinite runner, it had levels. Those will be placed in the obsolete folder, incase you want to look at them.

SpeedCube was developed in Unity, with C#.
