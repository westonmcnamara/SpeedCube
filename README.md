# SpeedCube
Infinite runner game. The player switches lanes to move out of the way of procedurally generated red blocks. Try and get the highest score. Do what you want with the source code.

Any scripts/models/scenes that arent in the release are in the "obsolete" folder. In the games first version before infinite runner, it had levels. Those will be placed in the obsolete folder, incase you want to look at them.

SpeedCube was developed in Unity, with C#.

# Input
Input in SpeedCube is simple and straightforward.

Switch Lanes: A/D | Left/Right Arrows <br/>
Restart Game After Death: Space <br/>
Main Menu: Escape <br/>

If you know a cheat code, do this to trigger it.

1. Start a new game. Cheat codes can be inputted in the death screen or during a game. Not through the main menu.
2. Hold down each key of the code simultaniously. Timing, order and other parameters are irrelevant. If a codes corresponding buttons are pressed simultaniously, it will activate.

NOTE: Cheat codes last for as long as you play the game. When the application is closed, you will have to re-enter them the next time you play.
